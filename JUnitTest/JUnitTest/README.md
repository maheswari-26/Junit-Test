# README
## This Java code provides implementations for three methods:

* square(int x) which squares a given integer x.
* divide(int a, int b) which divides integer a by integer b and returns the result as a double.
* count(String word) which counts the number of 'a' or 'A' characters in a given string word.
These methods can be used as part of a larger Java application or program.

##  Usage
Clone or download this repository.
Import the testing.JunitTesting class into your Java application.
Use the provided methods in your Java application as needed.
## Testing
The JunitTesting class has been designed for unit testing.

Import the JunitTestingTest class into your Java testing framework.
Test the square(int x), divide(int a, int b) and count(String word) methods as needed.
## Note: 
Ensure that the testing framework has been set up correctly and all necessary dependencies have been imported.
